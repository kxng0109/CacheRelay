/**
 * Boot-time seeding of configured bootstrap keys into Redis.
 *
 * <p>Seeding is triggered by {@link ApplicationReadyEvent}  -  i.e. only after the
 * application context (and the embedded web server) is fully ready  -  and retried on a fixed delay by
 * {@link #scheduledReseed()} until it succeeds. The first successful run latches the {@code seeded} flag so later
 * events are no-ops.</p>
 *
 * <p>Failure semantics are deliberately asymmetric:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Fail-open at boot level</b>  -  a Redis outage during startup never fails the
 *       application context. The failure is logged and the scheduled retry keeps
 *       attempting until Redis is reachable.</li>
 *   <li><b>Fail-closed at request level</b>  -  until keys are seeded, authentication
 *       lookups in {@link KeyManagementService} cannot resolve any key, so requests are
 *       rejected; once Redis is reachable, a Redis failure in the request path
 *       propagates and is mapped to HTTP 503 instead of silently treating keys as
 *       absent.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The fixed-delay retry reuses Spring's auto-configured task scheduler (enabled by
 * {@code @EnableScheduling} on {@code AegisGateApplication}); the interval defaults to
 * {@code 30s} and can be tuned via {@code gateway.bootstrap-keys-seed-interval}.</p>
