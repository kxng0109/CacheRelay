# CacheRelay high-throughput operations guide

> | Profile | Mix | Egress | Status |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | A — RPS-max | 95K small JSON (~950B) + 5K idle SSE | ~98MB/s | Achievable cache-heavy |
> | B — mixed (recommended gate) | 80K × 1KB + 25K SSE @ trickle | ~97MB/s | Achievable, balanced |
> | C — stream-max | 60K × 1KB + 50K SSE @ trickle | ~90MB/s | Achievable, stream-heavy |
> | Fantasy | 50K *active* completions / 100K large-JSON rps | 2–50× over line | Physically impossible here |

> Defaults (no profile) serve light/moderate load unchanged.

## Admission-gate tripwires (P1.0/P2)

- JUnit: `src/test/java/io/github/kxng0109/cacherelay/budget/GateThroughputSmokeTest.java`
  (2,000 `budget_limit.lua` decisions vs real Redis; floor + single-call ceiling).
- k6: `loadtest/k6/01-gate-smoke.js` (60s gate-only tripwire) + `02-gate-burst.js` (3m measurement).
- Short carrier A/B verdict (keep parallelism 4) + transient-noise analysis: the P2 note in
  `gate-checklist.md`. No capacity tuple is claimed until the P3 distributed proof signs off.

## RAM budget that closes (16GB)

OS 1G + Redis 2.3G + PG 2G + JVM heap 8G + direct 1G + non-heap 0.8G + headroom 0.5G.
8GB floor: OS 0.75G + Redis 1G + PG 1G + heap 4G + direct 0.5G + non-heap 0.5G;
SSE caps at 8KiB, OTel off-box, ZGC headroom violated → cap concurrency, do not tune around physics.

## Durability tradeoffs (stated plainly)

- Accounting tier is durable: AOF `everysec` + RDB snapshots (≤1s crash-loss
  window, gate path unblocked — fsync runs in the BIO thread). NEVER
  `appendfsync always` (~15K TPS cap). NEVER auto-restart the master
  (empty restart wipes replicas).
- Cache tier, rate windows (60s), and HITL pending (300s) are reconstructible;
  API keys re-seed from `GATEWAY_BOOTSTRAPKEYS_*`; HITL loss fails closed
  (deny resume).
- `synchronous_commit=off` scoped to ledger writes only: ≤600ms loss window on PG crash,
  covered by the app spillway WAL replay. Pricing/migrations stay synchronous.
- UNLOGGED staging vanishes on crash by design; spillway file/Redis journal is the backstop.

## Key-design rules (Cluster-ready, no rework later)

- `{tag}` every multi-key group: `ratelimit:{hex}:rpm|:tpm` (single-slot Lua).
- Prefixes: `ratelimit:` / `apikey:` / `admin:keys` / `cacherelay:cache:exact:` /
  `cacherelay:cache:vec:` / `mcp:hitl:` / `circuit:`.
- All cache/vector/HITL keys carry TTL (`allkeys-lru`-evictable); `apikey:*` and
  `admin:keys` live on the accounting tier (protected under `noeviction`).

## SSE reconnect + retry contract (client-facing)

- Streams are TCP-pinned: a dying pod/instance breaks the stream visibly. There
  is no server-side replay buffer — clients MUST reconnect with backoff and
  refetch (no `Last-Event-ID` resume).
- Send `Idempotency-Key` (1–255 printable ASCII) per logical operation and reuse
  it on every retry. The gateway derives a deterministic usage-ledger id from
  tenant + route + key + body fingerprint, so a retried request cannot create a
  second ledger row on any instance (effectively-once; true exactly-once is not
  claimed). Malformed keys are rejected with HTTP 400; absent keys keep the
  previous random-id behavior.
- Budget/rate counters still charge per attempt (atomic per call); the ledger
  row is what deduplicates. Keep client timeouts above p99 so retries stay rare.
